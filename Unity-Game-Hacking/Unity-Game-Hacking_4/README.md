## Challenge
```
How about hacking a real game on Steam?

There is a ROT13 string on a suspicious sign in the game. Please decode the string using ROT13 and format it as `flag{<decoded_string>}`. Note that you can solve this challenge by playing the game normally, but using Unity Game Hacking techniques can save a lot of time.
P.S: `len(decoded_string) == 13`
